# Wuerfeln - a dice app for iPad controled with an accessibility button
##About
This is an app that shows a virtual dice that can be controled by a volumne up press on a headphone remote.

The app was created as a little holiday project for a little friend of mine who has an iPad with an accessibilty button.
I connected the button with the headphone jack to the iPad using an additional chip to send the volumne up command.

Learn more about the project in a blog post (here)[https://arno.app/2019-09-01-holiday-project/]

*Sorry for the German strings and name - it was created for a German kid so I didn't bothered too long ;-)*


##Acknowledges
The app uses [JAQDiceView](https://github.com/JavierQuerol/JAQDiceView) as 3D scene for the dices. It was included directly in the code and modified a bit to work outside of a framwork.
